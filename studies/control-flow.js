/**
 * CONTROL FLOW:
 *  Statements: Code that performs an action
 * 
 * Conditional Statements allow us to control the flow of our application, boiling down comparisons and or values based on their
 * truthy-ness or falsey-ness.
 * 
 * Values will be coerced to or changed into a Boolean; meaning the value is evaluated in a Boolean context.
 * 
 * Again, we can make decisions in our code by asking true or false questions. 
 * 
 * Based on the answer, we decide what code runs if the question is true, and what code runs if the question is false.
 *
 * 
 * To do this, we use conditional statements. These are if-statements and their chains, if, elseif, & else. 
 * 
 * The anatomy of conditional statements consist of:
 * 
 * (a) Test-conditions in parenthesis ()
 * (b) BODY {} that is executed if condition is true.
 * 
 * 
 * (1) IF: 
 *  The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy. 
 *  If the condition is falsy, another statement in the optional else clause will be executed.
 *  To start a conditional block of code, you first use an IF statment.
 * 
 * (2) ELSE IF:
 *  You can then chain together any number of ELSE-IF statements to your first IF.
 * 
 * (3) ELSE:
 * Following the IF and the ELSE-IF chains, or only the IF statement, you can append a deafult ELSE, to the end of the chain.
 * If the previous conditions were not met, then the follow statement will execute.
 * 
 * (4) SWITCH: 
 *  We can also use switch-statements similarly to control flow.
 *  The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
 *  Sometimes a cleaner alternative over IF-ELSE IF-ELSE chains, but still serves same function in terms of Control Flow.
 * 
 *  The switch statement evaluates an input expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.
 * 
 *  A break statement should end the case. Failing to do so will cause the next block to execute, most probably unintentionally.
 *
